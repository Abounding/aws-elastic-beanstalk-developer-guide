# eb init<a name="eb3-init"></a>

## Description<a name="eb3-initdescription"></a>

Sets default values for Elastic Beanstalk applications created with EB CLI by prompting you with a series of questions\.

**Note**  
The values you set with `init` apply only to the current directory and repository\.

## Syntax<a name="eb3-initsyntax"></a>

 eb init 

 eb init *application\-name* 

## Options<a name="eb3-initoptions"></a>

If you run eb init without specifying any options, the EB CLI prompts you to enter a value for each setting\.

**Note**  
To use eb init to create a new key pair, you must have `ssh-keygen` installed on your local machine and available from the command line\.


****  

|  Name  |  Description  |  | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  `-i` `--interactive`  |  Forces EB CLI to prompt you to provide a value for every eb init command option\.  The `init` command prompts you to provide values for eb init command options that do not have a \(default\) value\. After the first time you run the eb init command in a directory, EB CLI might not prompt you about any command options\. Therefore, use the `--interactive` option when you want to change a setting that you previously set\.   |  | 
|  `-k` *keyname* `--keyname` *keyname*  |  The name of the Amazon EC2 key pair to use with the Secure Shell \(SSH\) client to securely log in to the Amazon EC2 instances running your Elastic Beanstalk application\.  |  | 
|  `--modules folder-1 folder-2`  |  List of child directories to initialize\. Only for use with [Compose Environments](ebcli-compose.md)\.  |  | 
|  `-p` *platform\-configuration*  `--platform` *platform\-configuration*  |  The [platform configuration](concepts.platforms.md) to use\. You can specify a platform name, a platform name and version, a solution stack name, or a solution stack ARN\. For example: [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb3-init.html) Use [`eb platform list`](eb3-platform.md) to get a list of available configurations\. Specify the `--platform` option to skip interactive configuration\.  When you specify this option, then EB CLI does not prompt you for values for any other options\. Instead, it assumes default values for each option\. You can specify options for anything for which you do not want to use default values\.   |  | 
|  `--source codecommit/repository-name/branch-name`  |  AWS CodeCommit repository and branch\. See [Using the EB CLI with AWS CodeCommit](eb-cli-codecommit.md)\.  |  | 
|  [Common options](eb3-cmd-options.md)  |  |  | 

## AWS CodeBuild Support<a name="eb3-init-codebuild"></a>

If you run eb init in a folder that contains a [buildspec\.yml](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html) file, Elastic Beanstalk parses the file for an eb\_codebuild\_settings entry with the following format:

```
eb_codebuild_settings:
  CodeBuildServiceRole: role-name
  ComputeType: size
  Image: image
  Timeout: minutes
```

CodeBuildServiceRole  
The name \(not ARN\) of the IAM role for AWS CodeBuild\. This value is required and if omitted any subsequent eb create or eb deploy command fails\.

ComputeType  
The amount of resources for the Docker container\. Valid values are BUILD\_GENERAL1\_SMALL, BUILD\_GENERAL1\_MEDIUM, and BUILD\_GENERAL1\_LARGE\.

Image  
The name of the Docker Hub or Amazon ECR image that AWS CodeBuild creates for Elastic Beanstalk\. This value is optional and if omitted the eb init command prompts you for a platform and other options\. see [Build Environment Reference for AWS CodeBuild](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-env-ref.html) for a list of images\. 

Timeout  
The duration, in minutes, that the AWS CodeBuild build runs before timing out\. This value is optional\. See [Create a Build Project in AWS CodeBuild](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/create-project.html) for the default value and range of values\.

**Note**  
Some regions don't offer AWS CodeBuild\. The integration between Elastic Beanstalk and AWS CodeBuild doesn't work in these regions\.  
For information about the AWS services offered in each region, see [Region Table](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/)\.
