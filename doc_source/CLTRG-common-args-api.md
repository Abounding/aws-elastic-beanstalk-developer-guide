 This tool, the Elastic Beanstalk API CLI, and its documentation have been replaced with the AWS CLI\. See the [AWS CLI User Guide ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/) to get started with the AWS CLI\. Also try the [EB CLI](eb-cli3.md) for a simplified, higher\-level command line experience\. 

The command line operations accept the set of optional parameters described in the following table\.
