# Managing and Configuring AWS Elastic Beanstalk Applications<a name="applications"></a>

The first step in using Elastic Beanstalk is to create an application, which represents your web application in AWS\. In Elastic Beanstalk an application serves as a container for the environments that run your web app, and versions of your web app's source code, saved configurations, logs and other artifacts that you create while using Elastic Beanstalk\.

**To create a new application**

1. Open the [Elastic Beanstalk console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk)\.

1. Choose **Create New Application**\.

1. Enter the name of the application and, optionally, a description\. Then click **Next**\.

After creating a new application, the console prompts you to create an environment for it\. For detailed information about all of the options available, see [Creating an AWS Elastic Beanstalk Environment](using-features.environments.md)\.

If you have no further need for an application, you can delete it\.

**Warning**  
Deleting an application terminates all associated environments and deletes all application versions and saved configurations that belong to the application\.

**To delete an application**

1. Open the [Elastic Beanstalk console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk)\.

1. Choose **Actions** next to the application that you want to delete\.

1. Choose **Delete Application**
