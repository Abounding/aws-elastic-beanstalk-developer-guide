# Getting Started Using Elastic Beanstalk<a name="GettingStarted"></a>

To help you understand how AWS Elastic Beanstalk works, this tutorial walks you through creating, exploring, updating, and deleting an Elastic Beanstalk application\. It takes less than an hour to complete\. 

There is no cost for using Elastic Beanstalk, but the AWS resources that it creates for this tutorial are live \(and don't run in a sandbox\)\. You incur the standard usage fees for these resources until you terminate them at the end of this tutorial\. The total charges are typically less than a dollar\. For information about how to minimize charges, see [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free)\.
